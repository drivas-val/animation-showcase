Initially, I was expecting the course to be based on normative films or well renowned films within a wider ranger of genres, but the class made me realize that even within one genre, there is a big span of differences between animation techniques, storytelling, and universal themes. In my portfolio, I make it clear that the changes in the forms of animation can completely change how viewers interact with the films, and many times it also affects how the effects of the themes being portrayed. I genuinely enjoyed breaking down the animation techniques for different films since before the course, I didn\u2019t think much about how animations were created, although I did have an idea of the complexities that they contained so my appreciation for them grew alongside every novel film that we watched.",(0,e.jsx)("br",{}),(0,e.jsx)("br",{})," In addition to the animations, learning about the directors and their influences to creating the animations helped to not only better appreciate the films, but also gave us an idea of the depth that many directors have when making these films. One important change of mind that I had during the semester was no longer believing that animated films were just made for children. Many of the films we watched had goals and ideas that went well beyond what a child would be able to understand. Take for example, Persepolis, a film that addresses the stained history of a nation while showcasing the cultural beauty that it encumbers. Similarly, Studio Ghibli creates films that are directed toward younger audiences, however, even those animations are filled with complex ideas of environmentalism, internal struggles, and societal injustices. This lead to my interest in learning more about the personal lives of the directories, and as it turns out, they make much of their personal experiences and dilemmas a part of the films they create. In other words, in watching an animation you are watching fun movie meant for entertainment, but you are also seeing into a person\u2019s mind.",(0,e.jsx)("br",{}),(0,e.jsx)("br",{}),"In terms of writing, I learned that there is a lot packed into particular points in an animation that can only be uncovered when one takes the time to dig into the nuances of a film. When writing my essays, I couldn\u2019t imagine that I would be able to write much about a single point of the films, however, once I rewatched the movie and dived into some of the influences, I realized there was much to unpack. There were many instances where minor parts of an animation that I didn\u2019t think much about turned into a writing goldmine when I looked at the scene from a different lens. This lead me to actually enjoy the writing aspect of the course since I had much to say about what I was uncovering and which also lead me to explore similar films from the directors to watch on my own. Now, even when I watch films for my own personal enjoyment, I find myself taking notes of what I would be writing about if I would be making a reflexion or writing about it in an essay. Overall, this has made my experience when watching animations more enjoyable, and I\u2019ve definitely gone through a learning curve in terms of my appreciation for them."]})})]})]})})}export{o as default,l as meta};
